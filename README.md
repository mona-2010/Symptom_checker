Symptom Checker Web Application

Introduction:
The Symptom Checker web application is designed to help users identify potential health conditions based on the symptoms they are experiencing. 
By selecting symptoms from a list, users receive a probable diagnosis along with precautions and suggested medicines.

Requirements:
1. Python 3.x
2. Flask Framework
3. HTML, CSS, and Jinja2 templates for the front-end
4. A web browser for accessing the application
5. A text editor or IDE for modifying the code
   
Software Used:
1. Python: Used for backend logic and handling HTTP requests and responses.
2. Flask: A lightweight web framework for creating the application.
3. Jinja2: A templating engine for rendering dynamic HTML pages.
4. HTML & CSS: For designing the user interface.
5. A text editor like Visual Studio Code or PyCharm for development.
   
Features:
1. A dynamic and responsive user interface for selecting symptoms.
2. Probable diagnosis based on selected symptoms using a Stack and Queue implementation.
3. Recommendations for precautions and medicines tailored to the diagnosis.
4. Attractive gradient background with smooth animations.
5. Easy navigation and user-friendly interface.
   
Technology Used:
1. Python: Backend development.
2. Flask: Web framework for handling routes and HTTP methods.
3. HTML, CSS: Designing and styling the front-end.
4. JavaScript (optional): Enhancing interactivity (if needed).
5. Data Structures: Stack and Queue for processing symptoms and conditions.
   
Conclusion:
The Symptom Checker application demonstrates how modern web technologies can be combined with fundamental programming concepts like data structures 
(stack ,queue ,dictionary ,set) to create a useful and interactive tool. This project not only provides health-related insights
but also serves as a practical example of building a web application using Python and Flask.
